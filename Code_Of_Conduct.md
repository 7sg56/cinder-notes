# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We're building Cinder Notes as an open, welcoming project. We want everyone — regardless of experience level, background, identity, or how many Stack Overflow tabs they have open — to feel comfortable contributing.

## Our Standards

**Be excellent to each other.** That's really it. But to be more specific:

### ✅ Do

- Be kind and respectful
- Give constructive feedback (critique the code, not the person)
- Welcome newcomers — we were all beginners once
- Assume good intentions
- Help others learn
- Celebrate contributions, no matter how small

### ❌ Don't

- Harass, insult, or demean others
- Make personal attacks or use discriminatory language
- Dismiss someone's ideas without explanation
- Gatekeep ("you should already know this")
- Be a jerk (you know what this means)

## Scope

This applies to:
- GitHub issues, PRs, and discussions
- Any project-related communication
- Representing the project in public spaces

## Enforcement

If someone is making the community feel unwelcome:

1. Politely call it out if you feel comfortable
2. Report it to the maintainers by opening a private issue or emailing us
3. We'll address it — violations may result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal

We're students running this project. We don't have a legal team or an HR department. But we *will* take this seriously and do our best to keep this space positive.

## Attribution

Inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and common sense.

**TL;DR:** Be nice. Help each other. Build cool stuff. 🔥
