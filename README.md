# Cinder Notes

Welcome to the Cinder Notes project.

## Project Status: Scaffolding

We are currently in the **scaffolding stage** of development. The core infrastructure and design patterns are being established to support the application's growth.

## Roadmap & Next Steps

Our immediate development focus is on the filesystem integration:

### 1. File Tree Implementation
We are implementing the file explorer and tree structure. Use Tauri's `fs` (FileSystem) APIs to read directories, manage files, and populate the file tree.
- **Goal**: Create a fully functional file browser within the app.
- **Tech**: Tauri FS / Node.js.

### 2. Feature Additions
Once the file system foundation is in place, we will proceed with adding core note-taking features, rich text editing, and other planned functionality.

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
We will continue to refine the user interface and experience, ensuring it is intuitive and user-friendly.

### 4. Encryption
We will implement encryption for sensitive data to ensure user privacy and security.

### 5. To be decided
